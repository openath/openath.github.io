Does OpenTrack sound like the solution to streamline your federation, and save the hours of admin time that could be better spent delivering athletics for your athletes?

Get in touch at [info@opentrack.run](mailto:info@opentrack.run) and we will be happy to provide a demonstration on a video call, or simply provide more information about how you can make your athletics easier.

OpenTrack's Federation Management System was originally part-funded by European Athletics to help with the growth of the sport, and they and World Athletics can give financial support to developing nations to digitize using ours and similar systems. You can contact their development departments for more information.
