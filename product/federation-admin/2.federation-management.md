## __2__ Federation Management

### 2.1 Data Visibility
OpenTrack understands that not everyone should see the same data, and with varying levels of access from federation administrators down to athletes themselves, ensuring only the right people have access to the right information is easy.

### 2.2 Club Administration
Club administrators can add new athletes, manage existing members, and check/update members' current status with the club, federation, or other body in the sport.

By default we make non-personal information information as public as possible, enabling athletes and parents to spot and report mistakes quickly and reducing future issues.

### 2.3 Licence Management
Athlete licences are an important source of revenue for federations, but managing these without a proper solution can be challenging and time-intensive.

Using OpenTrack, issuing new licences and managing existing ones is simple, whether for individual athletes or entire clubs.

Managing licences on OpenTrack means that when using our Competition Management System, athletes' eligibility can be checked before they step foot on a track, leaving you to focus on what really matters come competition day!

With reports that can be generated on-demand, or with a pre-determined frequency, you'll always have the clearest possible picture of who is in the sport.

For federations giving bib numbers to athletes for an entire season, this can also be managed and automated, and full integration with our Competition Management System means one less thing to do during competition preparation.

> "Licensing insertion and verification is almost gone (before it took 1-2 months).  
Bibs distribution and preparations for completion is much quicker (before it took 3-4 days, now 3-4 hours)."    
<small>Sirje Lippe, General Secretary, Estonian Federation</small>

### 2.4 Competitions and Entries

OpenTrack's Competition Management System provides an easy and robust way to manage and deliver competitions, from grassroots to the world stage, and can be used by federations, clubs, or any other event organiser.

With multiple ways to enter competitions, suited to all manner of competition type, OpenTrack reduces the barriers to getting athletes active and competing!

For competitions using individual entries, athletes can use their OpenTrack profile to enter meetings anywhere in the world, while our team entries process is perfect for clubs looking to enter their athletes in bulk.

> “We planned to run the new entry system in parallel with spreadsheets for a new competition, but
after one hour the clubs said they were not going back…”  
<small>Kristel Berendsen, Competition Manager, Estonian Federation</small>

### 2.5 Multiple Languages
We understand that English is not everyone's first language, and OpenTrack has been designed with translation in mind. With multiple languages already available to our FMS users, adding your own is simple.

> "One of our objectives was to have our results available in Greek.  
OpenTrack's user-friendly system has allowed us to do this.”  
<small>Katia Evangelou, Administrator, Cyprus</small>
