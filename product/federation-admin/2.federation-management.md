## __2__ Federation Management

### 2.1 Data Visibility
OpenTrack understands that not everyone should see the same data, and with varying levels of access from federation administrators down to athletes themselves, ensuring only the right people have access to the right information is easy.

### 2.2 Club Administration
Each club administrator can add new athletes as they come into the sport, see all their members and their current status. They can make or request changes to be made.

    {%- include icons/ipad-black.svg width="516" height="362" class="d-block" -%}
  </figure>
</div>

By default we make this information as public as possible (with the exception of personal information), enabling athletes and parents to spot and report mistakes quickly.

### 2.3 Licence Management
Licence statuses can be applied to athletes using the system.

To request a new license the club admin simply clicks on the athlete.

Every night, the federation will get an email alert with the athletes waiting.  When licensing is complete the validity will be extended.

For countries using a national numbering scheme, this is where the Federation can issue a bib number to the athlete, which is then visible to everyone for the rest of the season.

> "Licensing insertion and verification is almost gone (before it took 1-2 months).  
Bibs distribution and preparations for completion is much quicker (before it took 3-4 days, now 3-4 hours)."    
<small>Sirje Lippe, General Secretary, Estonian Federation</small>

### 2.4 Entering Competitions

A major purpose of the system is to manage entries to competitions.   
You can see upcoming competitions which are open for entries on the front page of your web site.

The team manager selects athletes for each event by simply selecting the event and then clicking on the athletes name from a drop down list. Predictive text speeds the process up for large clubs. The system ensures that only those with the correct gender and age enter each event.

> “We planned to run the new entry system in parallel with spreadsheets for a new competition, but
after one hour the clubs said they were not going back…”  
<small>Kristel Berendsen, Competition Manager, Estonian Federation</small>

### 2.5 Multiple Languages
We understand that English is not everyone's first language, and OpenTrack has been designed with translation in mind. With multiple languages already available to our FMS users, adding your own is simple.

> "One of our objectives was to have our results available in Greek.  
OpenTrack's user-friendly system has allowed us to do this.”  
<small>Katia Evangelou, Administrator, Cyprus</small>
