## __4__ Open Data and Integrations

With OpenTrack, you will always have full access to all of your data, and will never be asked to pay to access it.

We aim to make as much non-personal information public as possible, so that athletes, coaches, and parents can quickly spot mistakes, and report or correct them; and so that volunteers can do exciting things with the data.

We recognize the need to integrate with other systems and import and export data freely, so we make it as easy as possible to retrieve data in machine-readable formats like JSON, Excel, and PDF.

Competition organisers have full access to data on their competitors, and federation staff can access everything in their country.

For developers, we already have JSON URLs, APIs and Push notifications - all the tools you need to turn OpenTrack data into something spectacular. Just get in touch!

As well as providing data, and we also collect information from a variety of sources to keep things running smoothly, including Tilastopaja, World Athletics, and the Power of 10.
