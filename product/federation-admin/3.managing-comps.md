Countries adopting OpenTrack's Federation Management System get full access to the Competition Management System for their national-level events.

Seamless entries, easily navigable start lists and results, and two-way integrations with multiple statistical partners all provide a top-level experience for athletes, coaches, parents, and fans, with federation officials benefiting from the comfort of working with a fully documented and constantly developing system.
