## __1__ Introduction

OpenTrack's Federation Management System has been developed in collaboration with European Athletics to provide a streamlined and low-cost way to manage athletes, coaches, clubs, and competitions. We currently work with national federations in more than a dozen countries to make their athletics administration simple.
