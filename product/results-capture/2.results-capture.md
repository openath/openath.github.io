## __2__ Results Capture

The Results Capture System has the facility to input all required data to provide information relevant to the event and results.

### 2.1 Venue Selection

OpenTrack have an opensource list of most of Europe's athletics tracks enabling easy and accurate venue selection. New venues can be added <a href="https://data.opentrack.run/v/">here</a>.

### 2.2 Event Selection

All IAAF events are covered by Results Capture meaning low-key club meetings through to national level competitions with multi-events, heats and rounds can easily be inputted using OpenTrack's system. 

### 2.3 Competitor Entry

There are two methods for entering athletes depending on what is required:
* Individual Entry - this is useful for adding missed competitors or adding individual information
* Bulk Entry - this is very efficient as it means all competitors can be copied and pasted straight into the system from an initial entry list

### 2.4 Inputting Results

* Race Results
  * Manual Entry - Similarly to adding competitors to the event, results can be added either individually or by bulk copy and paste. Both of these are considered manual entry although the bulk entry process is very fast and efficient
  * Timing  Systems - OpenTrack has software allowing results to be automatically uploaded immediately after the event has finished if the meeting is using either FinishLynx or TimeTronics

### 2.5 Result Status

__Why does the status matter?__

Results can be entered at any time, however they are only fully official when the match referee has approved them. It is important people understand the status of the results when they are looking at them. Events can exist in one of 3 states, each is colour coded on the display of the events.

1. In-progress - the event has not finished (or perhaps even started yet)
2. Provisional - results are not complete or have not been approved (yellow banner)
3. Official - final results have been entered and approved.

After the event the results will be available on our website or can be downloaded in various formats. 

Fans can see the result details or even replay the field events graphically.
