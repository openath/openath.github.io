## __3__ The Future of the Sport

From local club open meetings through to national level events, athletics is in need of a more standardised system to display results in a uniform manner within immediate completion of the event. 

For the first time, this system is now readily available through OpenTrack. If you are interested in using the format or would just like to have a chat about the idea, please do not hesitate to <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a> with our friendly team of athletics enthusiasts!
