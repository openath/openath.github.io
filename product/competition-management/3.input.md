## __3__ How does it work?

### 3.1 Data Input - Basic Configuration ###

There is a full management menu system for the race/meeting organiser that is logically displayed. Using a simple hierarchical menu, all the event details can be entered including, but not limited to:

* Event entry
* Age group event limitations
* Event timetable
* Team competition configuration and scoring
* Links between heats and finals
* Athlete check in features

### 3.2 Event Customisation ###

After completing the basic configuration set up of an event or athletics meet, a microsite for the match is displayed. This allows complete customisation of aspects such as the venue, event list and athlete entry.

Organisers are able to take advantage of the following features, amongst many others:

* Athlete information
  * Competitors can be loaded across a full range of events in bulk, saving lots of time

* Athlete bib numbering
  * Once athletes have been entered bib numbers can be automatically allocated, allowing easy result identification. This can be done in a number of ways allowing organiser flexibiiity. They can choose from:
    * Pre-assigned bibs if they have already allocated
    * Historic bibs if copying from a previous event
    * Alphabetic
    * Alphabetic by event

* Athlete seeding
  * By entering a qualifying performance, such as personal best or season's best, meeting organisers can choose for athletes to be seeded for events. This facilitates things such as automatic lane selection and/or event exclusion
  * All IAAF athletic events are covered and the CMS can deak with the complexities of major competitions such as heats rounds & finals and multi-evemts.

### 3.3 Inputting Results ###

* This uses the same technology as <a href="/product/results-capture.html">Results Capture</a> meaning spectators can benefit from live updates as the events unfold keeping the meeting engaging and easy to follow. 
* If there is a team competition then the scores are continually updated live. 
* Using the live field event input screens, each jump or throw is stored and fans can graphically view the rankings and historical distances as the competition evolves.
* Results can be available to view or download from the website immediately
  * Upon initial input, results are always marked as "Provisional" until the meeting organiser changes this to "Official".
