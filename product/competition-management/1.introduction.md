## __1__ Introduction

OpenTrack’s Competition Management System (CMS) is a robust solution for athletics competitions that allows meeting organisers to manage events of any discipline, from small-scale open meetings to major national and international championships.

At OpenTrack, we understand that the sport never stops developing, and so neither does our CMS. [Fully documented](https://docs.opentrack.run/), and developed with user experience and simplicity in mind, there is no better solution for delivering top-tier competitions.

Key benefits:
* Entry payments are handled automatically and centrally — no chasing late payments!
* Extensive integrations simplify exchanging data with chip timing providers, statistics databases, or photofinish or field results software.
* Volunteers and organisers spend less time on admin, and more time on making competitions happen.
* Anyone can view results quickly and in a convenient format, with results APIs to enable developers to build on top of OpenTrack.

The CMS is a combination of our <a href="/product/results-capture.html">Results Capture</a>, <a href="/product/entries-system.html">Entry System</a> and much more.
