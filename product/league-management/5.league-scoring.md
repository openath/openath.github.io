## __5__ League Scoring

A league is nothing without a league table, and leagues on OpenTrack benefit from versatile scoring across seasons, no matter the discipline.

### Team Scoring

With OpenTrack you can effortlessly aggregate match scores over a season, with powerful scoring functionality allowing live updates to league scores while matches are in progress, scoring across multiple divisions, and breakdowns per division, discipline, or event.

### Individual Scoring

For road and cross-country leagues, rewarding the fastest and most consistent athletes across the year is just as easy â€” whether scoring only an athlete's best races across a season, or only rewarding those who showed up at every round, anything is possible.
