## __2__ Declarations and Entries

Capturing entries in a manageable, convenient, and consistent format can be a challenge — if you're a league organiser, you'll know how much time can be saved by avoiding the need for tidying up and reformatting data, or a tonne of manual data entry.

OpenTrack's LMS allows clubs to manage their own entries and declarations, ensuring accuracy, with organisers receiving standardised data that's ready to be used within OpenTrack's CMS.

### Road/XC Leagues
For road and cross country leagues, team managers can pay for athletes, assign them numbers from within their club's allocation, and declare them for each round of competition, ensuring that start lists are always up to date.

### Track and Field Leagues
For track and field leagues, OpenTrack's team declarations and flexible eligibility criteria make sure that the right athletes end up in the right events.

Organisers can issue individual or team bib numbers — the OpenTrack CMS handles either effortlessly.
