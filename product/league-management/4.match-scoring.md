## __4__ Match Scoring

Scores across an entire season are the engine that drives most leagues, but nothing beats the excitement of seeing your team surge into the lead of an individual match.

With versatile scoring that is capable of handling any scenario, and customisable down to the last result, OpenTrack can help deliver a top-tier matchday experience.

### Team Scoring

Whether scores are based on finishing position, performance, age grade, or any other factor, OpenTrack has the tools to turn results into points that are updated live, visible, and shareable.

### Individual Scoring

It's not all about teams â€” sometimes individuals who deserve some of the glory. OpenTrack's powerful individual scoring tables mean that you can reward the biggest individual points scorers too.
