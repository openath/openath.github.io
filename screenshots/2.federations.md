<a href="/product/federation-admin.html">Federation Management</a> is the system designed for federations to look after all aspects of their nation's athetics, such as setting up championships, approving licences, assigning coaches etc. Below are just some of the examples of what the Federmation Management System can do.

### 2.1 Getting Started

Within Federation Management, nations can upload their entire athlete database to action multiple procedures. These include but are not limited to creating competitons, licensing athletes, allocating coaches and finding season rankings. A nation's entire athletic database can be managed through this system.

Below is the homepage for Malta's Federation Management microsite. From here it is easy to navigate through to Athletes, Clubs, Coaches, Competitions, Leagues, Sport Facilities & Rankings.
