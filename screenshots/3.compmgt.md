The <a href="/product/comnpetition-management.html">Competition Management System</a> is the perfect system for the complete management of your athletics events, ranging from a local X-Country race through to a large scale track and field open meeting. 

Below are some screenshots of the system being used by meeting organisers when setting up various aspects of an event. 

### 3.1 Match Configuration

This image is the Match Configuration screen where meeting organisers detail initial set up components, such as athlete eligibility and how to allocate age groups. On the left hand side you can see various other editable tabs.

### 3.2 Adding Competitors

We have two different methods for adding competitors. 

* In bulk - athletes are pasted in from a pre-populated list, usually created in a spreadsheet
* Individually - this is useful for federations where athletes are have a unique ID, by which they can be located. This is often used in open meetings where athletes arrive and sign up on the day.

### 3.3 Event Entry

Events can be added in a similar way to competitors; pasted in bulk from a pre-populated list.

### 3.4 Timing Integration

OpenTrack has software that can be downloaded to automatically synchronise with two of the major finish line softwares; FinishLynx & TimeTronics. Once done, via a very quick, simple and easy process, results are sent up into the cloud straight after athletes finish and can be seen on the OpenTrack site immediately.

### 3.5 Results Input

If not using electronic finish line software, then results can also be inputted manually. Similar to competitor entry, this can be done in bulk or individually.
