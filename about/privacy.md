title: Our Privacy Notice
---

This notice has been produced in compliance with the European Union General Data Protection 
Regulations and UK Data Protection Act 2018 to inform our customers, clients and business 
partners how and why we use personal data.  
 
### Why we need your data

Personal data is essential to the sports services that OpenTrack offers, specifically:
* Athletics Management Services for Federations and Clubs;
* Track & Field Competition and Championship Management; and
* Athletes’ performance rankings and sports media publication and broadcasting.

OpenTrack is dedicated to helping sports organisers manage their membership, events and 
competitions more easily (efficiently and effectively) than ever before.  We also provide 
interactive media services that enhance the sports experience for both participants and 
audience to promote participation and enjoyment of sport.

### Athletics Data

The Athletics Data we need has been defined by European Athletics to include the following:
* First name and last name
* Gender
* Date of birth
* Competition nationality
* Club membership details and identifiers, including expiry and transfer dates
* Membership or license status with any federations, including expiry dates

This data is needed to organise competitions, calculate rankings, and will be recorded in 
competition results that are published and broadcast in sports news items, reports and articles. 
Whilst the athletes’ data of birth is required to confirm age-group qualification it will translated to 
the athletes’ age when used in published results.    

### Additional Personal Data

As well as your Athletics Data we will need Additional Personal Data:
* Contact details such as address, email, mobile numbers and social media user names
* Proof of identity, age and nationality
* Eligibility for a specific area/country/national competition or representational team
* Participation and performance records, photographs, sports news reports and articles  

This contact data is essential for organising your participation in events but will not be used for 
other purposes without your permission. Whereas, your image may appear in photographs and 
video coverage of competitions and be identified to you through your Athletics Data.

### Who we work for (our clients) and who we share your data with

We provide services to Competition Organisers (including clubs, schools, universities, regional 
associations) and to National Federations, to help them take entries and manage competitions.  
We process data on their behalf, with their permission and under their control.  A key part of the 
service is a database that stores the Athletics Data on the athletes.  We will exchange your 
Athletics Data with other parties as instructed.  For example, if your club enters you in a 
competition, we will pass some of your Athletics Data to the competition organiser.  

If we receive competition results, we will pass these onto recognised statisticians in the sport, 
such as Power of 10 in the UK, Tilastopaja in Finland (who maintain European rankings), or the 
IAAF.

### Our Individual Customers 

If you sign-up with us directly, for example, to enter a competition or manage your sports profile 
and performance metrics, we will control your Athletics Data and Additional Personal Data.  We 
will process the majority of your data for as long as you are an active member and for up to 6 
years after this.  Records of your involvement in a particular competition, on team sheets, on 
results pages or in sports reports, photography or video coverage may be held indefinitely both 
by us, sports governing organisations and our partners in order to maintain a record of the sport.  

Where this data is published or broadcast it will no longer be subject to our control.
