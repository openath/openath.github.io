Louis is studying Law at the University of Birmingham, training with the university's athletics club. He’s been involved in running the club’s open meets since his first year, and is a qualified track judge.

This year he will be leading the competitions committee, continuing to put on some of the best open meets in the country, with athletes coming from far and wide while taking strategic steps to ensure the meets remain financially responsible, not only being self-sufficient but also bringing income into the club.
