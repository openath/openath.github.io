Jonny Currie is a designer with a specialism in Usability and User Experience (UX).

Whilst studying mathematics at the University of Birmingham, Jonny became an integral part of the university’s athletics club committee, overseeing their PR & digital media strategy. He launched the club’s website in 2017 (the first of its kind for a stand-alone university sports club), and continues to work with the Head of Athletics, Senior Coaches, and Club President to promote the club and their track & field competition series.

During his postgraduate masters in UX Design, he began working with OpenTrack on the back of co-founding and pioneering the successful Virtual National Road Relays. He now leads the company’s design & prototyping of new features & software development projects.
