Henceforth, all of our news articles <a href="https://opentrack.substack.com">will be here</a>.

It used to take us a long time to put stories up here, as someone with web development skills would need to prepare and upload images.  This resulted in us not updating you as often as we should have.

We're now using the popular <a href="https://substack.com">Substack</a> platform, which will let us author much more quickly, and allow more people on the team to do so.  This should result in much more frequest news articles, product release notes, tips and tricks.

All stories for 2023 are on both platforms, and older news will be preserved here.
