This is a new format for team athletics competitions, being launched internationally next year. It includes many innovations to make an exciting and fun team competition, with many new wrinkles, and can be adapted to youth, club and university level easily.

These are designed both to be fun and rewarding for the athletes, and also a great watch for spectators.  The event is going to be filmed, and the edited version shown at the European Athletics Conference next month, as they develop this new format for the sport.

We're looking for more athletes to come down on Sunday and do a fun session.   We need to create 6 club / composite teams on the day - each of which require between 4 and 6 athletes of each gender.  We're offering £20 to the first 50 athletes to sign up (and come down).   <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/obPi04eIVZRZfXjJ2">Sign up here...</a>

Each athlete should expect to do 2-3 events on the day, in the course of the program (although if you want a great session, you can do more!).  There is no need to go all-out and you can treat it as a fun group session, or a social "sports day". The programme includes

 - Men’s Javelin and Womens’ High and Long Jump, in an innovative knockout format.  
 - Relays and paarlaufs
 - 100 / 110 hurdles (lower heights to encourage participation)
 - a “Mini-athlon” - a multi-events fitness challenge in 5 minutes
 - A handicapped distance medley relay to finish, so the first runner home wins the match

Overall, this is a fun and exciting new development for the sport with support from the very highest level.  It will be on the international stage in 2019 at the European Games.  England Athletics is following with interest too.  This gives you an opportunity to experience it and your feedback may influence how the sport develops.

We also welcome spectators, officials, coaches and helpers.  Your feedback will help to shape the final events, at which GBR and others will compete in future.  

Please do sign up, or (if you can bring some athletes or friends on the day) email Andy Robinson (andy@reportlab.com) or ben@bennoadcoaching.com.  Or give us a call in the morning on 07725 056175
