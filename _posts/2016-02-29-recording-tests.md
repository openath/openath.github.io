Dash for the Splash

We'd previously tried out our back end API at the last Surrey League race on 14th February, and learned a lot of lessons.  The changes this time were...

 - a custom HTML keypad with bigger buttons than the normal iPhone dialogs
 - gloves and styluses, to prevent freezing fingers
 - separate modes for recorders and timekeepers
 
Things went well on the recording at the back of the funnel.  The challenges were fairly mundane:  a lack of pins resulted in many people with flapping numbers, and we only had two people on the funnel.

We also shot a finish line video using a GoPro-style camera.  


Blah Blah
