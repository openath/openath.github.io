With the road running season underway, the indoor season drawing to a close and the track season looming large, things are as busy as ever at OpenTrack.

This was evidenced by another weekend of gargantuan athletic variety, and much to savour incoming.

The Teddy Hall relays remain as popular as ever and we took the entries for 556 athletes who filled the 133 teams.  As one might expect Oxford Uni won the men’s and ladies whilst the lesser known Burgess’s Major Carrolling Studs took the mixed.

There was a wonderful turnout for the Northern Ireland and Ulster Junior Indoor Championships for which OpenTrack handled the requirements of 565 competitors over 100+ events for the U13-U19 range.  A few days earlier there had been another busy meet up in Falkirk, the highlight of which was 16 year old Brodie Nixon carding 7.50s for the 60m.

In Norway, 444 competitors headed to the Leikvang Friidrettshall in Trondheim, whilst we also handled the entries up in Ulster again for a 5k on the Coleraine Campus for 406 souls.

It’s great to see how popular the pentathlon remains.  184 competitors headed to Lee Valley for their 35+ championships with a wide array of results, including a busy 3k championship as well [won by Mike Cummings in 9:01, and Anna Critchlow still goes brilliantly, running 11:06 as a W55].  The great Jodie Albrow may now be into her 5th decade, but her athletics remains “on point”.  Here’s what she returned for the 60H, HJ, SP, LJ & 800.

Things don’t get much more grassroots than the "Basingstoke Throws winter series", but it’s sacrosanct we all do what we can to keep these vital parts of athletics going.  Not everyone is built to, far less wants, to run.  But 57 competitors here kept the flame burning, of which our top pick was 16 year old Eloise MacDonald hurling the Hammer 48.25.

At the St. John Athletic Track in Malta, OT welcomed 180 young athletes’ entries, which saw two U15 girls run 26 for the 200, and 14 year old Nick Bonett run a 24.4.

One of our tiniest hubs is the cacophony of athletic joy in the Aland Islands with 61 results being returned at the Eckerohallen.  We were also up in Trondheim for the Klubbmesterskap Ranheim friidrett.
Finally, last Sunday we were back at Lee Valley and were honoured to support the BFTTA [Be fit today track academy] where we took entries for 321 competitors.

**Incoming!**

And we can savour more of the same this weekend – more wonderful athletics, from far and wide.  The enormously popular Friday Night Under the Lights 5k series in Battersea Park is back, or if more convenient, 481 miles to the North West perhaps the Altamuskin 5k in Omagh is more to your liking.

Birmingham University have a busy Winter throws and distance meet planned, whilst the Scottish Young Athletes road races are on where 385 competitors are set to tear up the North Berwick macadam, with 6 races over distances from 2.5 to 5k.

The thriving hub of the Middlesex indoors [back at Lee Valley] is here with 317 names taken by OT, whilst the Serbian Junior championships are on in Belgrade, whilst entries are still being taken for the Kalesija championships in BIH.

Finally, looking ahead to 21 March and we’re delighted to be taking entries for one of the Schools Olympic projects that we support in Marsa, Malta.

It’s a feast of athletics all over Europe that we’re delighted to be a part of.
