This week OpenTrack, alongside partners European Athletics and the W3C (Spain office) are in Gijon, co-hosting another successful and well-attended AthTech; the annual Athletics Technology conference. 

It is here the heads of the sport are introduced to some of the technological advancements available in the sport. See <a href="http://athtech.run">here</a> for more details.

A variety of topics were covered from Standards & Data Management to GDPR & Sports Journalism. Part of the fun was having the opportunity to try some of the new technology at a local relay race, where the organisers also took part!
